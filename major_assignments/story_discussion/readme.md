# Story discussion project

This project will help you and your classmates understand how journalists use data to find and tell compelling, meaningful stories. It is worth 10 percent of your grade.

## How this works  

Each week, the entire class will read the same inspiring work of journalism that could not have been produced without original data analysis. And each week, everyone in the class will write a short forum post, which will prove you have some familiarity with the material. Deep reading is of course preferred, but not required.

Each week, a rotating team of two students will be assigned to do a deep dive on a story, share their findings with the class, and lead a short discussion.   

## Deliverables

* A 1.5 to 2 page, single-spaced memo (turned in online, and bring 20 copies to bring to class on the day of your presentation) that briefly describes the following points, with the following subheads for each section:
  * Summary | summarize the story and its major conclusions.  
  * The Data | describe the data used in the analysis, including details on how it was obtained. What did they go through to get it and prepare it for analysis?    
  * The Analysis | describe the nature of the analysis. What techniques did they use? Did they transparently describe their analysis in detail in a link from the project? Was their approach especially novel, or statistically complex? Does it seem like something you'll be able to do at the end of this class? Can you find the "data notebook" or code repository where they described their analysis, perhaps on GitHub.      
  * The Reporting | describe the reporting that went into fleshing out the stories.  What did they do to bring this story to life? Who did they talk to?  
  * The Storytelling | describe the quality of the writing and presentation.  Did the story feel "data heavy" or filled with numbers? Were the analysis findings described in a straightforward way? Did they use effective visuals to communicate complex topics?
  * Without the Data | imagine this story without the data analysis component. Is it still a story?  Is the story as strong?

* A Google Slides deck with six slides, one for each subhead in the memo.  You will be given a template to follow.

* A six-minute "lightning talk" presentation that uses the slide deck you've turned in, hitting the main points described in your memo.  Each person in a group should present for part of the time.      

* Five brief discussion questions (turned in online and 20 copies printed out to bring to class on the day of your presentation) or prompts to get your classmates to share their thoughts on the story and on your conclusions about the story.  These are up to you, but I'm happy to offer feedback in advance if you'd like to talk them out with me.

## Grading

Grades will be assigned as follows.

* Memo - 35 percent
* Slide deck - 10 percent
* Presentation - 25 percent
* Discussion lead - 15 percent  
* Active discussion participant in weeks you aren't presenting - 15 percent
* Extra Credit - 5 percent.  Talk with a reporter or data journalist to find out how they got the idea to do the story, and how reporting contributed to the analysis.

## Partners and Story Assignments

You will work in teams of two.  If you have someone you want to work with, you are welcome to pair up.  If not, I will assigned partners based on random draw.  

You and your partner will skim through the stories and and post your top four choices, in order of preference, on a forum post. I'll then assign you a story, attempting to give everyone one of their top choices.

Everyone's materials will be due at the same time.  Presentations dates will be assigned at random.      

The groups are as follows:

* MH + SC + VD
* PVS + LM
* ACC + CTS
* GT + MS
* SM + JR
* MX + CD
* BW + RF
* RM + DM
