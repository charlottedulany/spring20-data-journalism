### Using public records laws to get data

* Different from federal FOIA, but same concept.
* Every state has one, but the details are different. They are designed to  
* Sometimes called Sunshine Laws or Freedom of Information Act Laws or Public Information Act laws.
* Knowing the specifics of state law in which you're requesting is helpful.  
* The law is your friend! Knowing it can mean the difference between getting info you need in a timely fashion and getting denied.
* Muckrock guides and ag opinions.  Every state will have them. Links in syllabus.


### Exercise: what's accessible in Maryland.
* What information is exempt and not exempt. Exempt in maryland: home addresses of public employees. Search term: "public employees". Page 3-18.  
* How long agencies have to respond. Maryland, agencies have 10 biz days to send you a response saying they approve or deny, and a total of 30 days to turn over records, but if ready before then, must release asap. Search term: "Time for Response".  Page 4-2.  
* How much they can charge you, and if there's a waiver for fees for journalists.  Maryland has this. Search term: "Fees" - Chapter 7. Two hours free of search and prep time.  Can only charge you actual costs. Fee schedule.  In reality, a lot of leeway.  Search term: "Waiver of Fees" Page 7-3. A provision exists for "public interest".  
* Whether requesters have to give you, by law, a database in a format that is searchable and analyzable. Or whether they could be jerks and give you print outs of PDFs. Maryland has this. Page 6-2.  Search "searchable and analyzable".  
* Whether an agency can deny you access to a database that contains both public and non-public information or whether they have to, by law, release the parts to you that are public and hold back the rest. Maryland has this. Page 3-43 "Severability of exempt from non-exempt" search.  

### Writing public records request letters
* Use a template: [Sample request letters state by state](https://www.nfoic.org/organizations/state-sample-foia-request-letters) or [PIA letter generator](https://splc.org/lettergenerator/).
* Even if you are going to send a form in, I want you go to through this exercise.
* Provide as much detail as possible about records you are seeking, based on your reporting. Time period, name of data, sample fields.
* If you have determined the data contains information exempt from public records laws, ask them to redact that information and provide everything.
* Request a fee waiver (if the law allows for that), and an up-front estimate of costs before they begin work.
* Tone: Polite, professional and firm.
* Meticulously accurate, grammatical.  Treat this like a story, in terms of accuracy.
* Requesting from more than one agency? Multiple letters. Requesting multiple data sets from one agency? One letter.
* Do not send until I approve.

### Story discussion assignment
* What's due on Sunday.
* Story Discussion Project | Forum Post 2 | Post links to your completed memo (as a Google Docs link), Slide deck (as a Google Slides link), Discussion questions (as a Google Docs link).  
* Slide template
* Also, you need to read shoot to kill and do a brief forum post, because that's what's coming next week.
