* Using public records laws to get data
  * Different from federal FOIA, but same concept.
  * Every state has one, but the details are different. They are designed to  
  * Sometimes called Sunshine Laws or Freedom of Information Act Laws or Public Information Act laws.
  * Knowing the specifics of state law in which you're requesting is helpful.  
  * The law is your friend! Knowing it can mean the difference between getting info you need in a timely fashion and getting denied.
  * Muckrock guides and ag opinion
* Things that differ sometimes from state to state
  * What information is exempt and not exempt. Exempt in maryland: home addresses of public employees.
  * How long agencies have to respond. Maryland, agencies have 10 days to approve or deny, 30 days to turn over records, but if ready before then, must release asap.
  * How much they can charge you, and if there's a waiver for fees for journalists.  Maryland has this.
  * Whether requesters have to give you, by law, a database in a format that is searchable and analyzable. Or whether they could be jerks and give you print outs of PDFs. Maryland has this.
  * Whether an agency can deny you access to a database that contains both public and non-public information or whether they have to, by law, release the parts to you that are public and hold back the rest. Maryland has this.
* What's due:
  * Forum post: sample request letter(s).  Don't worry about Howard center address and all that stuff, but I do need info on where to send request letter.
  * Requesting from multiple agencies? Multiple letters.
  * Detailed information about what we're seeking.  
    * that's why we've done all this reporting.
    * Names of agencies.
    * Names of database and time period.
    * Reference phone calls with people you've talked with!
    * Spell check and grammar. Be careful.  PROFESSIONAL.
### Openers

#### Questions ABOUT Lab
* How did we do?  Anyone run into issues that could be helpful to review?
* Questions about the lab you did two weeks ago? Anything people didn't understand? I'll be walking around and you can ask.  
* This week's lab will be posted by end of day tomorrow.  For real.

#### Discussion: why do we use these script files?
* We could use spreadsheets.
* We could just write r code in the console.  

ASK: Why do we do this?
* Allows us to keep track of our work.  If we make an error at any step, we just go back and fix and run it all again? Lets us come back years later.
* Allows our colleagues to feel confident in our work, including our editors who may not be data saavy and our colleagues who may not be data saavy.  True when we explain step by step.
* Allows our work to be easily fact-checked and reproduced by others with data knowledge.
* Makes others feel confident in our methods, including the general public and experts. We can send our files to experts for review.  
* Teaching!!!! THis is the my favorite reason.  We don't learn in a vacuum.  

#### Data acquisition

**Talk to one-on-one**

* Dana: switch assignments.
