#### Post Opioid Story. -5 mins

Pull up post story on screen.

Will be working with this all semester.

What is the data:
* ARCOS DEA database, which in its raw form, has one row per shipment from a manufacturuer to a distributor to a pharmacy, with lots of details. We've been working with aggregate data so far.
* Got from intervening in a LAWSUIT.  The good shit is not always easy to get.
* Released to the public. Is it all opioids? No, just hydrocodone and oxycodone, most common drugs.  It affects our analysis.  


Lots of you identified this fact:
* "Just six companies distributed 75 percent of the pills during this period: McKesson Corp., Walgreens, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen, CVS and Walmart, according to an analysis of the database by The Washington Post. Three companies manufactured 88 percent of the opioids: SpecGx, a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt; Actavis Pharma; and Par Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Endo Pharmaceuticals."
* Used data analysis to say WHO is responsible for flooding the market.

Lots of you identified this fact:
* â€œthe states that received the highest concentrations of pills per person per year were: West Virginia with 66.5, Kentucky with 63.3, South Carolina with 58, Tennessee with 57.7 and Nevada with 54.7."
* Used data analysis to say WHO is most harmed.  Joined two data sets together to get this info.  Called an "enterprise join", will talk more.

Who did it?
* Some of you picked out Andrew Ba Tran, Steven Rich and Aaron Williams.  But the truth is
everyone plays a role.  Understanding the data is critical, and reporting plays into it. All that context and sourcing helps understand how to use the data, what questions to ask, and how to make sense of it.  Analysis is not separate from reporting. It's part of it.

#### Review Data Acquisition project - 20 mins

* Let's take 5 minutes, define partners.
* What's expected this week.  

#### Review lab for today -

* You're going to build on work we learned over the weekend.
* Working with aggregate data, not raw data, but a bit more.
* One sheet for distrubtors to one county, for manufacturers and for pharmacies.

#### Lab guidelines - last 10 minutes of class.

Have open spreadsheet for Logan County WV we did for in class exercise.  

Show how they were broken down into totals.  Not the raw data.  

These were generated from the raw data. And if you really want to do this work, you need to start working with raw data.

That's what we're going to do today, and we're going to use an incredibly powerful tool. Pivot tables.
