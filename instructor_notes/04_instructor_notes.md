### Announcements

* Answer keys to last week's in-class assignment and last week's lab posted above
* Grading: If you have a zero, talk to me.
* Comments on assignments. Check the comments on assignments.  I'm offering feedback, advice and asking questions.
  * Ask: do people know how to see comments?

### Last week's take home lab
* Knitting.  Don't worry if you can't do it.  But generally, it will give you an error message that tells you what line the problem was on.  Some common ones:
  * You have an uncommented install.packages() line
  * You have something you intended to comment, like a sentence, that you didn't actually comment out.
* Sorting highest-to-lowest v lowest-to-highest. desc() vs nothing.
* Finding strings at the end of a statement. Purpose of question.
  * Show how to modify query.
  * Ask how people found the answer to this question.  Google.  But what to google?
    * What DIDN'T WORK FOR YOU
    * Some of you "filter mingo data set end of word" (too specific)
    * Some of you added str_detect, because I gave you that clue.  
    * Some of you added r into your queries or dpylr or tidyverse
  * Purpose of question: this is data programming.  You have a question.  You need to "operationalize it", to turn it into something the computer understands.  You may have done that thing 1000 times and know exactly how to type it out.  You may have done it 1000 times and NOT know how to type it out exactly.  You may not have done it before.
  * With data programming, pretty much everything is possible, just a matter of figuring it out.  
  * What do you do? You google it. You try answers you find.  It doesn't work.  You get error messages.  You google error messages.  None of that works.  
  * So you try and translate the problem you're having into simpler terms.  The possibility that someone had the exact problem you're having while using the exact data set you are using is probably pretty slim. But the possibility that someone had a similar problem while using a different data set is HIGH.  You just need to learn to generalize.
  * If you think doing all this stuff means you are bad at this because you don't know how to do ALL THE PROGRAMMING, I have news for you: you are not! It means you are GOOD at the programming, because this is an essential part.  Being bad at programming would mean you can't do what you're doing and you just stop trying.
  * I love this Tweet from Janna https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1025226989953679361
* Any other questions.

### How the post got opioid data
* Who wants to summarize, how did the post get this data? A lawsuit intervention that failed at first, then an appeals court ruling.
* Not every request takes a protracted legal battle.  But it does take WORK, often.  So many of you are figuring this out now with your data request process.
* Q: Why did DOJ want to keep this data secret? Syd: "In 2018, an attorney within the Justice Department told U.S. District Judge Dan Polster that the ARCOS database should remain largely confidential to “protect trade secrets, the location of warehouses containing drugs and ongoing and future criminal investigations.”
* Q: Why did the companies want it kept secret?  Trade reasons but also embarassing and a PR nightmare!

#### Data acquisition
* Better than last week, thank you. All of you by now have internalized that this is WORK.  
* A few things to reiterate:
  * Some of you are not getting phone calls returned.  Send an email and make a phone call EVERY DAY.  Do not let them ignore you. Have some self respect!
  * Some of you still have information to get before we can send a records request.
  * Look at comments on your latest forum post FROM ME. If I have said we need to talk to plot a path forward, we need to plot a path forward, so flag me down. In other cases, I might tell you what to proceed with and what to drop.
  * What's due: an update on information.  If you at this point know exactly what data you're seeking, the office that has it and what you'll need to do to do a formal request, just say that in your update.  But if you STILL have reporting to do, tell me what more you've found.  
  * NO ONE SHOULD SEND IN FORMAL REQUEST YET, EITHER BY EMAIL OR FILLING OUT A FORM. THAT WILL COME NEXT WEEK.
* Excuses
  * Good posts on excuses.  All were good!Just want to hit a few.
  * Some of you have heard some good one already.
    * Sean:  Excuse: There are confidential records mixed in (I've received a version of this as an explanation for why data that's available on the web doesn't contain 100% of police calls for service) Response: Then (please) take them out. AWESOME.  Most states have a redaction clause.  Just because it's confidential in part doesn't mean the whole thing is confidential.  Redact! In most cases, it's trivial to exclude a column or two from a data dump.
    * Syd: "It will cost a lot of money" - $10K.  Explain to class WHY it will cost a lot of money.  Have to print out and redact information by hand!!!! We're going to try to talk them out of it, to work on exporting redacted information.
    * Victoria: you hadn't heard this yet, but I liked the hypothetical. "Excuse: We don't know how to do that" "Sample Response: Don't you know how to do your job?" but as you pointed out you would NEVER say this.  As you said: "You need all the honey you can get when dealing with these people". Polite but firm. Professional.  No your rights, but remember in so many cases people can make life hard for you if they want to: delay, deny.
    * Charlotte: Okaloosa County Florida told you "we've never done that before".  Amazing! Good response.  If they can't figure out, we'll show you how.  Also, I guarantee someone on staff knows how to export the records we need.   
    * DARRYL: Q: "It's not a public record". A: "Show me the law".  Good.  The law is your friend.  Most states have a list of things that ARE and ARE NOT public records.  Knowing the law gives you a good barganing position.  We'll talk next week about some ways to figure out what's covered and not covered in each state.  
    * Jake: "Our programmer is too busy with official business." Response: A public records request IS official business, it is part of your agency’s mission, do it.  PUBLIC RECORDS are an afterthought for many places. BUT BE NICE.  If you get that, just put it in.

#### What's due this week
* In class assignment will be due at end of class.
* Weekly lab will be due.  
  * Note there are two videos to watch: one on how to use GitHub, and one how to do more stuff with R. Watch both!
  * Submission is to a file you've uploaded to GitHub this week.  You will not be able to upload files.  Do not EMAIL me files through ELMS or through.
  * Study session is on Friday.  Either come to that, or come see me some other time.  I'd recommend not waiting until weekend, if you've never used GitHub before.
* Short reading and forum post on reading.
* Another data acquisition forum post.
* NOT DUE THIS WEEK, BUT WEEK AFTER, YOUR STORY DISCUSSION MATERIALS.
