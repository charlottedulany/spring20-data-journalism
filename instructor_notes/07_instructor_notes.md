### Chicago Tribune Reading

First story: pharmacists ignoring drug pairs.
* More straightforward analysis method.
* Key notes: They BUILT a database. tested 255 pharmacies to see how often stores would diagnose dangerous drug pairs.  
* The analysis was then simple: majority = more than half.
* WHY HAPPENING? Data couldn't answer.  Reporting through interviews found: speed and market forces.

Second story: identifying dangerous drug pairs.  
* VERY complex. Used machine learning classifier to predict whether a particular drug combo was problematic.  A form of machine learning: code that you can teach.  Parse through a bunch of data, and learns. Well beyond scope of this class.   
* I have a data science masters degree, and I wouldn't feel comfortable doing this work on my own.
* Tribune partnered with researchers, who did this work.  They published an academic paper! https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40264-016-0393-1#Sec2
* One takeaway: doing something even a little complex, working with experts and helping develop methods and results is KEY.   https://www.cjr.org/first_person/could_collaborating_with_scientists_be_the_next_step_for_investigative_reporting.php
